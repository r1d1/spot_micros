# Parts
- We have enough parts to build 1 spot micro

# Planning
- We can have the Apprentice from Simon print parts for one spot micro
- First print two legs so we can start testing them

# Microcontroller
- Try out both esp32 and raspberry pi
  - Not sure if esp32 is powerfull enough to do everything

# PCA9685
- Have to figure out the max load

# OS and Control
- ROS Kinetic
  - Can be a starting point for using ROS: https://github.com/mike4192/spotMicro
- ROS2
- MicroROS
- MicroPython
- Arduino flavoured C++

# Load Test plan
1. Print 1 or 2 legs
2. Run with PCA9685
3. Measure how much current is used
4. Break a leg

# Meetings
- Try to do a meeting/hackathon every 2 to 3 weeks
- Thursday's end of afternoon/evening

# Time Schedule
- March, April:
  - Print parts for 1 spot micro
  - Perform Load test
  - Try out different OS 
- May:
  - Build first complete spot micro
